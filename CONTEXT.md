# Vigil — Build Context

## Last Updated
2026-04-08

## Current Phase
**Pre-build** — Plan finalized, repo created, waiting for teammate review before Phase 1.

## What Exists

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Project charter: mission, MVP flow, scope boundaries, build order, agent behavior rules |
| `PLAN.md` | Full implementation plan: architecture diagrams, directory structure, all 10 phases, tech decisions |
| `.gitignore` | Python, Node, Docker, IDE exclusions |
| `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` | Start in plan mode for multi-file changes, verify after edits, respect demo scope |
| `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc` | Deterministic core, LLMs only for explain/patch/critique, explicit schemas |
| `.cursor/rules/safety.mdc` | Never "fix" vulns by suppressing rules, removing auth, or widening trust |

## What Does NOT Exist Yet
- No backend code
- No frontend code
- No demo repo
- No Docker setup

## Tech Stack Decisions (Locked)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python + FastAPI |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS |
| Scanner | Semgrep CLI (deterministic, no LLM) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude (via `anthropic` Python SDK) |
| Database | SQLite via aiosqlite |
| Streaming | Server-Sent Events (SSE) via asyncio.Queue |
| Export | Self-contained HTML report (Jinja2) + ZIP fallback |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Three Agent Roles

| Role | Type | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hunter** | Deterministic | Runs Semgrep, normalizes findings into typed schema |
| **Surgeon** | LLM (Claude) | Generates minimal patch for a single finding, supports retry with Critic feedback |
| **Critic** | LLM (Claude) | Independently reviews patch, approves or rejects with concerns list |

## Key Architecture Rules
- Deterministic spine first, LLM features second
- Every scanner output normalizes to `Finding` schema
- Every patch targets a single finding
- Critic has no access to Surgeon's reasoning (independent)
- Verification runs on a sandbox copy, never the original
- Surgeon-Critic feedback loop: max 2 attempts
- All agent steps publish SSE events for live UI streaming
- Trace events stored for full Hunter -> Surgeon -> Critic -> Verifier history

## Data Models (To Be Implemented)
- `Finding` — scanner result normalized to common schema
- `PatchProposal` — unified diff + explanation + attempt number
- `CriticVerdict` — approve/reject + reasoning + concerns
- `VerificationReport` — scanner rerun result + test results
- `TraceEvent` — agent activity log entry

## API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
- `GET /api/repos` — list curated demo repos
- `POST /api/runs` — start audit run
- `GET /api/runs/{id}` — run metadata
- `GET /api/runs/{id}/stream` — SSE event stream
- `GET /api/runs/{id}/findings` — findings list
- `GET /api/findings/{id}` — finding detail
- `POST /api/findings/{id}/patch` — trigger Surgeon-Critic loop
- `POST /api/patches/{id}/verify` — sandbox verification
- `GET /api/runs/{id}/export` — HTML report or ZIP bundle

## Build Order
1. Contracts and data models
2. Scanner runner + findings normalization
3. Run API + SSE streaming
4. Findings explorer backend
5. Patch proposal pipeline (Surgeon)
6. Critic review + feedback loop
7. Verification pipeline
8. Export bundle (HTML report)
9. UI (Next.js)
10. Demo repo + Docker

## Session Log

| Date | What Happened |
|---|---|
| 2026-04-08 | Created AGENTS.md, PLAN.md, .gitignore, cursor rules. Initialized git repo. Pushed to GitHub. Plan finalized with 5 upgrades: feedback loop, SSE streaming, vibe-coded demo repo, agent personas, HTML export. |

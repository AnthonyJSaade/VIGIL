## Last Updated
2026-04-20

## Current Phase
**Phase 10 complete — MVP fully operational.** Demo repo created (`demo-repos/vibe-todo-app/`), semgrep installed, end-to-end smoke test passed (8 Semgrep findings detected). Docker setup added (backend Dockerfile, frontend Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml). All 10 phases of the build plan are complete.

## Recent Fixes
- **2026-04-20 — Sandbox verification hang.** `verify_patch` could hang forever when the Surgeon produced a malformed unified diff: `patch -p1` failed with "malformed patch at line N", then the `-p0` fallback prompted `File to patch:` on `/dev/tty` and blocked indefinitely because stdin had already been closed by `communicate()`. The hung subprocess kept the background task alive, so `VERIFICATION_COMPLETED` was never published, the UI polled `/verification` 404s forever, and orphaned `patch` processes + uncleaned `vigil-verify-*` temp dirs destabilized Docker Desktop's VM (surfacing as "unexpected EOF"). Fix in `backend/app/verification/sandbox.py:_run_patch`: pass `--batch` to `patch` so it exits non-zero on any ambiguity instead of prompting, plus a `PATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30` safety-net `asyncio.wait_for` mirroring the existing pattern in `scanner/runner.py:run_semgrep`. Malformed diffs now fail fast (~20ms total) with a clean report surfaced in the UI.

## What Does NOT Exist Yet
- All planned phases are complete. Remaining work is testing, polish, and presentation prep.

## Tech Stack Decisions (Locked)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python + FastAPI |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS |
| Scanner | Semgrep CLI (deterministic) + Claude LLM review (hybrid pipeline) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude (via `anthropic` Python SDK) |
| Database | SQLite via aiosqlite |
| Streaming | Server-Sent Events (SSE) via asyncio.Queue |
| Export | Self-contained HTML report (Jinja2) + ZIP fallback |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Three Agent Roles

| Role | Type | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hunter** | Hybrid (deterministic + LLM) | Phase 1: Semgrep scan. Phase 2: Claude code review. Deduplicates overlapping findings. |
| **Surgeon** | LLM (Claude) | Generates minimal patch for a single finding, supports retry with Critic feedback |
| **Critic** | LLM (Claude) | Independently reviews patch, approves or rejects with concerns list |

## Key Architecture Rules
- Deterministic spine first, LLM features second
- Every scanner output normalizes to `Finding` schema
- Every patch targets a single finding
- Critic has no access to Surgeon's reasoning (independent)
- Verification runs on a sandbox copy, never the original
- Surgeon-Critic feedback loop: max 2 attempts
- All agent steps publish SSE events for live UI streaming
- Trace events stored for full Hunter -> Surgeon -> Critic -> Verifier history

## Data Models (Implemented)
- `Finding` — id, run_id, scanner, rule_id, severity (error/warning/info), message, file_path, start_line, end_line, snippet, confidence (float, default 1.0), metadata, created_at
- `PatchProposal` — id, finding_id, diff, explanation, model_used, attempt (1 or 2), prior_concerns (list or None), created_at
- `CriticVerdict` — id, patch_id, approved (bool), reasoning, concerns (list), model_used, created_at
- `VerificationReport` — id, patch_id, scanner_rerun_clean (bool), tests_passed (bool or None), details, created_at
- `TraceEvent` — id, run_id, role (hunter/surgeon/critic/verifier), action (enum of 12 values incl. llm_review_started/completed), payload (dict), timestamp
- `Run` — id, repo_id, status (pending/scanning/completed/failed), finding_count, created_at

## SQLite Tables (Implemented)
- `runs`, `findings`, `patches`, `verdicts`, `verifications`, `trace_events`
- All have async CRUD helpers in `backend/app/db.py`

## API Endpoints

Implemented:
- `GET /api/repos` — list curated demo repos
- `POST /api/runs` — start audit run (launches bg scan)
- `GET /api/runs/{id}` — run metadata + status
- `GET /api/runs/{id}/stream` — SSE event stream (text/event-stream)
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/findings` — findings list (filterable by severity, scanner)
- `GET /api/findings/{id}` — single finding detail with snippet + metadata
- `POST /api/findings/{id}/patch` — trigger Surgeon-Critic feedback loop (bg task, 202)
- `GET /api/findings/{id}/patches` — list all patch attempts with verdicts
- `POST /api/patches/{id}/verify` — trigger sandbox verification (only if Critic approved, 202)
- `GET /api/patches/{id}/verification` — verification result

- `GET /api/runs/{id}/export?format=html|zip` — export HTML report or ZIP bundle (attachment download)

All backend API endpoints are now implemented.

## Session Log

| Date | What Happened |
|---|---|
| 2026-04-08 | Created AGENTS.md, PLAN.md, .gitignore, cursor rules. Initialized git repo. Pushed to GitHub. Plan finalized with 5 upgrades: feedback loop, SSE streaming, vibe-coded demo repo, agent personas, HTML export. |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 1 complete: backend skeleton, 6 Pydantic models with enums, SQLite schema (6 tables), async CRUD helpers, FastAPI lifespan wiring. All verified. |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 2 complete: Hunter module — async Semgrep CLI runner (timeout, error handling, exit code awareness) + deterministic findings normalizer (severity mapping, snippet extraction). Verified with sample Semgrep JSON. |
| 2026-04-08 | Pre-Phase 3 review: fixed severity ordering bug (CASE expression), added insert_findings_batch, expanded db.py smoke test (Run + Finding + TraceEvent). |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 3 complete: SSE EventBus (publish/subscribe per run_id, auto-persists TraceEvents), GET /api/repos, POST /api/runs (bg scan task), GET /api/runs/{id}, GET /api/runs/{id}/stream (SSE). All routes wired into main.py. Verified with live server. |
| 2026-04-08 | Hunter expansion: Added hybrid scan pipeline. Finding model gets `confidence` field (float, Semgrep=1.0, LLM=0.6-0.9). TraceAction gets LLM_REVIEW_STARTED/COMPLETED. New `scanner/llm_reviewer.py` (Claude code review, skips Semgrep duplicates, structured JSON output). New `scanner/orchestrator.py` (two-phase pipeline, deduplication with 3-line tolerance, SSE publishing). `routes/runs.py` now delegates to orchestrator instead of calling Semgrep directly. DB schema updated with `confidence REAL` column. All verified. |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 4 complete: Findings explorer — `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/findings` (filterable by severity and scanner) + `GET /api/findings/{id}` (full detail with snippet + metadata). Wired into main.py. |
| 2026-04-08 | Phases 5+6 complete: Surgeon agent (`agents/surgeon.py`) generates minimal unified diffs via Claude. Critic agent (`agents/critic.py`) independently reviews patches — no access to Surgeon reasoning. Feedback loop orchestrator (`agents/orchestrator.py`) runs max 2 attempts with Critic concerns fed back to Surgeon. `POST /api/findings/{id}/patch` triggers the loop as a bg task (202). `GET /api/findings/{id}/patches` returns all attempts with verdicts. All SSE events published. |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 7 complete: Verification pipeline — `verification/sandbox.py` copies repo to temp dir, applies diff via `patch -p1`, reruns Semgrep, checks if original rule no longer fires. `routes/patches.py` adds `POST /api/patches/{id}/verify` (only if Critic approved) and `GET /api/patches/{id}/verification`. SSE events for verification_started/completed. |
| 2026-04-08 | Pre-Phase 8 review: fixed 3 bugs (silent patch pipeline failure on SSE, bus.close() never called, dead _read_source_file) + 2 hygiene issues (lazy imports, unused import). |
| 2026-04-08 | Phase 8 complete: Export bundle — `export/report_template.html` (Jinja2, self-contained dark theme, agent color-coding, diff rendering, trace timeline, print-friendly). `export/bundle.py` collects all run data, renders HTML or generates ZIP (report + JSON + diffs). `routes/export.py` serves `GET /api/runs/{id}/export?format=html|zip`. All backend API endpoints now implemented. |
| 2026-04-13 | Phase 9 kickoff: scaffolded Next.js app under `frontend/` (TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router). Home at `src/app/page.tsx` fetches curated repos from `http://localhost:8000/api/repos` (no-store). `repo-cards.tsx` client grid for selecting a repo (local selection state only; not wired to `POST /api/runs` yet). |
| 2026-04-13 | Phase 9 complete: Full MVP UI built. (1) "Start Audit" button in `repo-cards.tsx` calls `POST /api/runs` and navigates to run page. (2) `/runs/[run_id]` page with SSE live feed (`EventSource`), findings list on completion, export buttons. (3) `/findings/[finding_id]` page with code snippet, confidence score, patch request + diff viewer, Critic verdict panel, sandbox verification trigger and result. (4) Shared components: `live-feed.tsx`, `findings-list.tsx`, `severity-badge.tsx`, `patch-panel.tsx`. (5) Layout metadata updated. Build passes cleanly (TypeScript + Next.js). |
| 2026-04-14 | Post-review bug fixes: (1) **SSE delivery fix** — removed named `event:` field from SSE frames in `backend/app/streaming/sse.py` so `EventSource.onmessage` receives events (action is already in the JSON payload). (2) **Patch polling race fix** — `patch-panel.tsx` now keeps polling until a patch is approved or all 2 attempts are exhausted, instead of stopping at the first result (which hid the Critic retry). (3) **Home page error handling** — `page.tsx` catches backend-down errors and shows a fallback message instead of crashing. (4) **React lint fix** — wrapped `fetchRun` in `useCallback` in `runs/[run_id]/page.tsx` so dependency arrays are correct. (5) **Poll resilience** — `loadPatches` now catches network errors instead of throwing uncaught rejections every 2 s. (6) **Comment style alignment** — added JSDoc to complex functions in `patch-panel.tsx` and fixed header comment format in `severity-badge.tsx` to match backend docstring conventions. Build passes cleanly. |
| 2026-04-16 | Phase 9 v2: Replaced entire frontend with v0-designed UI. Deleted old `frontend/src/` scaffold. Copied v0 components (shadcn/ui + 10 Vigil-specific). Created `lib/api.ts` typed API layer (snake_case→camelCase, confidence 0-1→0-100). Rewrote all pages: Home (repo fetch + non-functional clone/upload), Audit (SSE AgentTimeline + stat cards + FindingsTable + correct export links), Finding detail (real API fetch + CodeBlock + PatchPipeline), Patch All (batch sequential processing). Updated tsconfig `@/*` alias from `./src/*` to `./*`. Removed unused `form.tsx` shadcn component. `next build` passes cleanly. |
| 2026-04-16 | Phase 10 complete: (1) Created `demo-repos/vibe-todo-app/` — ~160-line Express.js todo API with 9 intentional vulnerabilities split between Semgrep (SQL injection, hardcoded JWT, eval, CORS, path traversal) and LLM-only (missing rate limiting, no input validation, logging passwords, error stack leakage). (2) Added semgrep to `backend/requirements.txt`, installed v1.159.0. (3) Smoke-tested: `POST /api/runs` → scan completed → 8 Semgrep findings detected correctly. (4) Docker setup: backend Dockerfile (Python 3.12-slim + semgrep + patch), frontend Dockerfile (Node 22-alpine multi-stage with standalone output), `docker-compose.yml` (two services + demo-repos volume), `.env.example`. (5) Enabled `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts`. All 10 phases of the build plan are now complete. |
| 2026-04-08 | Eval prep — extra demo repos: Added 3 new curated vibe-coded repos (`vibe-notes-api` Flask, `vibe-file-share` Express, `vibe-auth-service` Express), each ~150-180 LOC with 9 planted findings. Registered all 3 in `backend/app/routes/repos.py` `CURATED_REPOS`. Introduced `.vigil/truth.yaml` ground-truth manifest schema documented in `demo-repos/TRUTH_SCHEMA.md` (fields: id, cwe, kind, file, line/lines, severity, detectable_by, notes). Wrote manifests for all 4 repos (backfilled `vibe-todo-app`). Calibrated `detectable_by` tags against Semgrep `--config auto` output: vibe-todo-app=11 findings (3 semgrep-expected, 8 llm-only — the better-sqlite3 `prepare()` wrapper defeats semgrep SQLi rules, strong LLM narrative), vibe-notes-api=9 (8 semgrep, 1 llm-only), vibe-file-share=9 (3 semgrep, 6 llm-only), vibe-auth-service=9 (3 semgrep, 6 llm-only). Total 38 planted findings, 17 semgrep-expected, 21 llm-only across 4 repos. No scanner/orchestrator changes; manifests are pure eval artifacts for the upcoming harness. |
